# 03 JavaScript: Password Generator

I Created an application that generates a random password based on user-selected criteria. The password can include uppercase, lowercase, numbers and Special charachters. This app runs in a browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript. It also features a clean and polished responsive user interface, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.
